The dataset includes tables for customers, invoices, tracks, albums, artists, genres, playlists, and employees. By writing SQL queries, the project demonstrates how relational data can support business decisions.

The analysis focuses on:

Customer Behavior: Identifying top customers, spending trends, and country-level sales.

Sales Performance: Finding best-selling tracks, top artists, and high-revenue genres.

Catalog Insights: Examining track details, genre popularity, and playlist patterns.
