This project provides a concise SQL-based analysis of a music store database to extract insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and catalog performance.

## 📊 Overview
The database includes tables for customers, invoices, tracks, albums, artists, genres, playlists, and employees. SQL queries are used to explore relationships, identify patterns, and answer key business questions.
