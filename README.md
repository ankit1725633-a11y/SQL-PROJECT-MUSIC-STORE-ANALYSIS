# 🎵 SQL Music Store Analysis Project

This project takes a hands-on look at a music store database using straightforward SQL queries. The goal is simple: understand how customers behave, what kinds of music sell the most, and how the store performs overall. Instead of focusing on technical complexity, the analysis stays practical and readable—something you might expect from a real analyst working through data step by step.

## 📊 Overview
The database includes familiar tables like customers, invoices, tracks, albums, and artists. By connecting these tables, we can uncover patterns that aren’t obvious at first glance.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Customer Behavior:** Which customers spend the most? Which countries bring in the highest revenue?
- **Sales Trends:** What tracks and genres consistently perform well?
- **Catalog Patterns:** How do genres and tracks vary in popularity, and what does that say about listener preferences?
- **Operational Metrics:** How do employees and locations compare in terms of sales?

## 🛠️ SQL Techniques
Used naturally as needed—joins, filters, aggregations, and sorting. Nothing overly engineered or artificially complex.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- A standard SQL client (DB Browser, DBeaver, or any equivalent)
- GitHub for version control and organization

## 🎯 Purpose
The project is designed to feel real and approachable. It’s meant to show how SQL can answer everyday business questions without sounding robotic or overly formal.

- `/results/` – Notes and summaries based on the query outputs
